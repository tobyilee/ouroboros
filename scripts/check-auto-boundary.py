"""Enforce the `ooo auto` product boundary at PR time.

Per Q00/ouroboros#725, `ooo auto` has a permanent product boundary:
`goal -> interview -> Seed -> handoff`. Domain-specific operational
workflows (GitHub PR ops, Jira, Slack, Linear, ...) belong in plugins,
not in core auto.

This script greps the `ooo auto` core source files for forbidden domain
keywords and exits non-zero if any are found. It is the mechanical
enforcement layer paired with #734's documentary work.

Run locally:
    python3 scripts/check-auto-boundary.py

CI:
    .github/workflows/auto-boundary.yml runs this on every PR.

Allowlist:
    Lines that genuinely need a forbidden keyword (rare; usually a
    legacy import) can be marked with the trailing comment
    `# domain-keyword-allowed: <reason>` to bypass the check. The
    marker is honored only when it appears inside a real Python
    comment token (the file is tokenized for this), so a stray
    "domain-keyword-allowed:" inside a string literal cannot be used
    to smuggle a forbidden keyword past the guard. Each allowlist
    usage requires reviewer sign-off.

Coverage strategy:
    The scan target is the *union* of (a) every `*.py` under
    `src/ouroboros/auto/`, plus (b) explicit extra files such as
    `src/ouroboros/cli/commands/auto.py`. New files added under the
    auto package are automatically covered. A small set of ANCHOR_FILES
    is checked for existence; if any anchor is missing the guard fails
    loudly so a refactor that renames or removes a load-bearing file
    cannot silently strip enforcement coverage.

Pattern strategy:
    Forbidden patterns are Python regexes scoped with inline
    case-insensitivity flags (``(?i:...)``) so each pattern can mix
    case-insensitive and case-sensitive sub-matches as needed. This
    catches realistic identifier forms (`GitHubClient`,
    `github_client`, `PullRequestHandler`, `pullRequestId`,
    `LinearClient`) without false-positiving on benign code such as
    ``linear_time``, ``linearize``, or "linear pipeline" -- the
    Linear-the-product pattern requires either the URL form, a
    PascalCase composition (lowercase ``linear`` + an explicit
    uppercase letter), or one of an enumerated set of integration
    suffixes.

    Each keyword carries TWO recognition forms so that compound
    identifiers across naming conventions are not silent bypasses:

    1. *Token-start* form: anchored by ``(?<![A-Za-z])`` so the keyword
       starts after a non-letter (start-of-line, whitespace, ``_``,
       digit, punctuation). This catches ``GitHubClient``,
       ``GITHUB_TOKEN``, ``github_client``, ``_github_url``, and the
       SCREAMING_SNAKE form ``FOO_GITHUB_BASE``.

    2. *camelCase-boundary* form: anchored by ``(?<=[a-z])`` (lowercase
       letter on the left) plus a *case-sensitive* uppercase first
       character of the keyword. This catches mixed-case compounds like
       ``openGithubIssue``, ``makePullRequestUrl``, ``sendToSlack``,
       ``openJiraIssue``, and ``notifyLinearAdapter`` -- the exact
       bypass class that earlier iterations of this guard missed -- while
       still rejecting the explicitly-benign embedded-substring forms
       that only contain the keyword in lowercase (``mygithub_thing``,
       ``mypull_request_data``, ``collinearPoints``, ``bilinearForm``,
       ``nonlinearAdapter``, ``nonlinear_adapter``). The discrimination
       is purely the case of the keyword's first letter at the boundary:
       lowercase = embedded substring (benign), uppercase = camelCase
       composition (domain leak).

# Forbidden domain keywords expressed as Python regexes. Patterns are
# intentionally precise: a guard whose patterns false-positive on
# benign code (e.g. ``linear_time``, ``linearize``, "linear pipeline")
# turns into a CI-noise generator and gets allowlisted into
# uselessness. ``(?i:...)`` is used for case-insensitive sub-matches;
# bracket character classes such as ``[A-Z]`` outside that scope stay
# case-sensitive, which is the exact discrimination needed for
# PascalCase-composition forms.
#
# Every keyword has TWO recognition arms (separated by ``|``):
#
#   * Token-start arm ``(?<![A-Za-z])(?i:<kw>)``: the keyword sits at
#     the start of a token (preceded by start-of-line, whitespace,
#     ``_``, digit, ``/``, ``"``, etc.). Case-insensitive, so it
#     catches ``GitHubClient``, ``GITHUB_TOKEN``, ``github_client``,
#     ``_github_url``, and SCREAMING_SNAKE forms like
#     ``FOO_GITHUB_BASE``. We deliberately do *not* use ``\b`` here,
#     because ``_`` is a word character and ``\b`` would lose the
#     underscore-adjacent forms (``notify_slack_user``,
#     ``FOO_GITHUB_BASE``, ``linear_client``).
#
#   * camelCase-boundary arm ``(?<=[a-z])<KW first letter capitalized>(?i:<kw rest>)``:
#     the keyword sits at a camelCase boundary (lowercase letter on
#     the left, *uppercase* keyword first letter, case-insensitive
#     remainder). This catches ``openGithubIssue``,
#     ``makePullRequestUrl``, ``sendToSlack``, ``openJiraIssue``,
#     ``notifyLinearAdapter`` -- the bypass class earlier iterations
#     missed. The case-sensitive uppercase first letter is what
#     preserves the explicitly-benign embedded-lowercase forms
#     (``mygithub_thing``, ``mypull_request_data``,
#     ``collinearPoints``, ``bilinearForm``, ``nonlinearAdapter``,
#     ``nonlinear_adapter``): in those, the keyword's first letter is
#     lowercase, so the camelCase arm does not match.
