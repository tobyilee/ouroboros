"""Enforce RFC #1256 §I5 — PRs touching ``src/ouroboros/auto/`` must
include an R-run comparison section in the PR body.

The check is intentionally minimal: it does not parse the table, run any
benchmarks, or compare against historical baselines. It only verifies the
**presence** of the structured section so reviewers see the per-round
wall-clock data inline. Numerical regression detection lives in #1258
follow-up tooling.

The check runs in two contexts:

1. **Pull request CI** — receives the PR body via ``GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`` and
   verifies the R-run section + filled-in table when changed paths include
   ``src/ouroboros/auto/``.
2. **Local dry-run** — invoked manually as
   ``python3 scripts/check-auto-perf-budget.py --body <file>``; used when
   developing the workflow itself.

Exit codes:
    0 — compliant or not applicable
    1 — applicable but the PR body is missing the R-run section
    2 — unexpected error reading inputs OR changed-path discovery failed
        (the gate fails closed: if we cannot enumerate changed files, we
        cannot prove the PR is non-applicable, so we refuse to silently
        return 0 — this is the bot-review blocker that flagged the
        prior fail-open behavior)
