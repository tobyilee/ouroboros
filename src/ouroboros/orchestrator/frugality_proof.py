"""Deterministic frugality-proof machine (the seed's FrugalityProofTriad gate).

The hypothesis the seed exists to prove: *if work is decomposed well, each child
runs at a lower reasoning-effort and stays token-frugal WITHOUT losing grounding.*
This module is the deterministic, LLM-free judge of that hypothesis. It reads the
event stream a run produces, assembles one :class:`FrugalityTriadRow` per AC, and
computes a PASS/FAIL verdict — no model is asked anything, so the proof cannot be
reward-hacked.

A triad row joins three measured axes by ``ac_id``:

* **effort** — ``execution.ac.effort_routed`` (effort_level + effort_mode). Emitted
  today by the effort contract.
* **token** — ``execution.ac.token_attribution.reported`` (token_spend). Production
  side not wired yet (seed AC2).
* **grounding** — ``execution.ac.deliver_verdict`` (traceguard_verdict +
  unsupported_claim_rate). Production side not wired yet (seed AC4).
* **baseline** — ``execution.ac.shadow_replay`` (baseline_token_spend at parent
  effort). Production side not wired yet (seed AC5).

A row only ``counts_in_proof`` when effort was ENFORCED, the unit is a decomposed
child (the hypothesis is about children, not top-level ACs), the decomposition was
trustworthy, and all axes are present. The gate therefore returns
``INSUFFICIENT_DATA`` honestly until the token / grounding / baseline producers are
wired — and the *same* gate yields PASS/FAIL once they are. The contract (event
types + fields) is fixed here so the producers have a precise target.

    ``ac_id`` cannot be correlated and is skipped.

    Skipping the ``ac_id``-less event is **by design, not a gap**: the proof is a

    runs are intentionally out of the proof's scope rather than counted as
    missing-axis rows; only the parallel executor's per-AC events (which carry
    ``ac_id``) contribute.

    Rows are keyed by ``(run, ac_id)`` — **not** ``ac_id`` alone — because the proof
    spans runs (``min_runs``) and the same logical AC id recurs every run. Keying by
