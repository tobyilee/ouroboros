"""Effort-first investment routing for the Agent-OS execution contract (RFC #1405).

The orchestrator decides an abstract reasoning-effort *level* per unit of work and
hands it to whichever runtime will execute that unit. Each runtime declares, via
:class:`~ouroboros.orchestrator.adapter.RuntimeCapabilities.reasoning_effort_support`,
whether it can ENFORCE the level through a native per-call knob (Claude Agent SDK
``effort``, Codex ``-c model_reasoning_effort``) or can only be *advised* of it.

This module is the single, pure decision point that sits between "what level do we
want" and "what each runtime can actually honor". Keeping it free of executor state
makes the policy testable in isolation and keeps the live executor a thin caller —
it lays ``parallel_executor`` on the capability contract instead of hard-coding a
backend-specific effort path.
