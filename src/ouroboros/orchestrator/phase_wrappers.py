"""PRE/POST phase wrappers for leaf prompts (RFC v2 H3, #830).

H3 reframes "execution phases" from per-skill markdown (`phase-task-start`,
`phase-task-end`) into harness-injected wrappers. The orchestrator
prepends a [PRE] block (restate AC, list assumed preconditions, name the
evidence schema) and appends a [POST] block (emit evidence record, do
not declare DONE — harness adjudicates).

This module is pure prompt-composition surface. parallel_executor and
execution_strategy still pass through their existing system-prompt
fragments; PR 9 wires `wrap_prompt` into the dispatch path.

Why wrap at the harness layer instead of in skill markdown:
  - The wrappers reference the active ExecutionProfile.evidence_schema
    directly, so the format stays in lockstep with the H2 validator and
    can never drift.
  - Skills cannot opt out, so the "do not self-declare DONE" rule from
    H1 is mechanical, not rhetorical.
  - Per-domain skills shrink because they no longer carry phase prose.
