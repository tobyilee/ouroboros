"""External verifier loop (RFC v2 H1, #830).

Wraps a leaf executor with a separate read-only verifier pass plus a
bounded retry. The verifier is intentionally model-agnostic at this
layer: it is any callable that, given the active profile, the leaf's
parsed evidence record, the AC text, and the raw leaf output, returns a
VerifierVerdict.

This module owns the verifier verdict contract consumed at the
`parallel_executor` atomic acceptance boundary. The full bounded retry
helper (`run_with_verifier`) remains available for the future live retry
loop once the failure taxonomy (H7) and routing (H5) hooks are promoted
into redispatch decisions.

Loop semantics:
    1. Executor produces a leaf output.
    2. The harness parses evidence (H2). If evidence cannot be extracted,
       that counts as a FAIL with a parser reason — verifier is NOT called.
    3. The harness validates the record against profile.evidence_schema.
       If the record carries a typed blocker, the loop terminates as
       BLOCKED without verifier invocation. Other validation failures
       short-circuit the verifier and retry (the leaf would never satisfy
       the contract even if the verifier said PASS).
    4. Otherwise the verifier is invoked. PASS → return. FAIL with
       retry_admission=RETRY → retry, feeding the verdict reasons back to the
       executor. Other retry admissions return immediately so the caller can
       redispatch, escalate, or block without burning the same-leaf retry budget.
    5. After `max_retries` exhausted retryable FAILs, return the last attempt with
       accepted=False so the outer orchestrator can escalate.

The retry budget defaults to K=2 per shaun0927's H1 sketch in #830.
