"""Profile-backed ExecutionStrategy (RFC v2 #830, PR 9 wiring).

The legacy `CodeStrategy / ResearchStrategy / AnalysisStrategy` triple
in `execution_strategy.py` reads its system-prompt fragment from
`src/ouroboros/agents/{name}.md` and hardcodes its tool list. RFC v2
moves both of those into the profile YAMLs so adding a new domain is
a YAML edit, not a Python + markdown edit.

This module ships a `ProfileBackedStrategy` that satisfies the existing
`ExecutionStrategy` Protocol but reads tools and system-prompt fragment
from a loaded `ExecutionProfile`. The system prompt fragment carries
the H3 `[POST]` block (`build_post_block`) so the evidence_schema
flows through `runner.build_system_prompt`; the `[PRE]` restate-and-
preconditions gate lives in `get_task_prompt_suffix` so it grounds in
the AC list `runner.build_task_prompt` renders immediately above it.

Opt-in by design — the default strategy registry in
`execution_strategy._STRATEGY_REGISTRY` is **not** modified by this PR.
Callers that want profile-backed behavior pass the new strategy
explicitly. The follow-up flip-the-default PR depends on shipping the
verifier + decomposer wire-ups (currently behind the open #830 stack).

Usage:
    from ouroboros.orchestrator.profile_loader import load_profile
    from ouroboros.orchestrator.profile_strategy import (
        ProfileBackedStrategy,
    )

    strategy = ProfileBackedStrategy(load_profile("code"))
    strategy.get_tools()                # from profile.suggested_tools
    strategy.get_system_prompt_fragment()  # H3-wrapped, profile-aware
