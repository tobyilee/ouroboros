# Issue #1248 PR-B review — the safe-default lateral escalation may only
# demote active ``CONSERVATIVE_DEFAULT`` ledger entries to ``ASSUMPTION``
# when the lateral persona response includes a machine-checkable clearance
# line. The auto pipeline's production ``ouroboros_lateral_think`` inline
# path returns a *prompt template* (not an executed judgement), so without
# this gate a bare prompt would be enough to reclassify entries — including
# entries that record genuinely unsafe scope (production deploys, credential
# handling). The canonical line, anchored to its own line so a stray mention
# inside prose does not satisfy the gate, is:
#
#     CLEARANCE: lexical_false_positive
#
# Any other shape (no marker, an explicit ``UNSAFE_CONFIRMED: <reason>``
# counter-marker, a plain prompt template) means *the lateral was attempted
# but no judgement is available* — the persona invocation is still recorded
# on ``state.personas_invoked`` for audit, but the ledger stays put and the
# loop either tries the next persona or, after both are tried, surfaces a
# typed ``unstuck_exhausted`` BLOCKED. This is conservative-by-default: the
# matcher fire stays loud (no silent closure on unsafe scope) until a real
# judge layered on top of the prompt emits the marker.

            # BLOCKER on 17703155): persisting a complete ledger before the
            # backend transcript reflects the answer creates a resume-time
            # transcript-sync gap. The previous order saved the complete
            # ledger first, then called ``backend.answer``; if that backend
            # call timed out or raised, resume would see the persisted
            # complete ledger, hit the ledger-primary closure gate above,
            # close as ``ledger_only``, and proceed to SEED_GENERATION —
            # but ``GenerateSeedHandler`` reads the persisted interview
            # transcript, not the ledger, and the backend never accepted
            # the last answer, so the Seed would be generated from stale
            # transcript evidence. Deferring the persistence keeps
            # ``state.ledger`` and the backend transcript monotonically in
            # sync: on backend.answer failure, ``state.ledger`` on disk is
            # the pre-answer state, resume re-enters the loop, the answerer

        Issue #1248 — when ``_unsafe_context_reason`` fires during a
        safe-default closure attempt, the SSOT #1157 L5 invariant
        requires escalation through bounded lateral persona reframes
        before falling to BLOCKED. ``self.lateral_thinker`` is the same
        callable shape the EVALUATE → UNSTUCK_LATERAL path uses, so the
        reframe inherits its timeout / error / persona-tracking
        contract.

        Behaviour:

        * Pick the next persona via
          :func:`select_persona_for_safe_default_block`, honoring
          ``state.personas_invoked``.
        * Invoke the lateral thinker once.

          - On **chain exhaustion** (selector returns ``None``), stamp
            the typed ``unstuck_exhausted`` reason on
            ``state.last_error_code`` and return the original
            finalization. The caller's BLOCKED branch then surfaces the
            typed terminal.
          - On **timeout** / **handler exception** / **transient
            ``LateralResult.error``**, record the persona attempt for
            audit + chain progression but leave ``state.last_error_code``
            alone so the existing ``interview_unsafe_gaps_remain`` /
            ``interview_max_rounds_exhausted`` code applies. Only the
            chain-exhausted path stamps ``unstuck_exhausted``.

        * On a successful lateral response, persist the persona's text
          on state for audit (``last_lateral_*``), append the persona
          to ``personas_invoked``, and — only if the response carries
          the canonical ``CLEARANCE: lexical_false_positive`` marker
          (see :func:`_lateral_response_authorizes_demotion`) — demote
          every active CONSERVATIVE_DEFAULT ledger entry to ASSUMPTION
          and snapshot the mutated ledger onto ``state.ledger`` before
          checkpointing so a resume after demotion sees the same input
          the runtime path saw. The re-run of
          :func:`finalize_safe_defaultable_gaps` then either clears
          ``unsafe_gaps`` (returning the new finalization) or surfaces
          the same matcher fire to the next persona.

        The function only mutates the caller's path of execution; the
        existing safe-default closure / BLOCKED branches downstream are
        unchanged. When ``self.lateral_thinker is None`` the caller is
        expected to short-circuit before invoking this method.
