        ``max_iterations`` caps the number of recorded repair attempts. Once
        ``len(history) >= self.max_iterations`` the loop returns the most
        recent reviewed ``(seed, review, history)`` — this is the upper bound
        the pipeline relies on to prevent unbounded LLM cost when the reviewer
        keeps producing the same finding.

        When the bound is reached *immediately after* applying a repair, the
        last cached ``review`` still describes the *pre-repair* seed; in that
        case we perform exactly one final reconciliation review so the
        returned ``(seed, review)`` pair is consistent. The pipeline persists
        ``state.last_grade`` / ``state.findings`` from this review, so a stale
        review here would block a seed that the final allowed repair actually
        fixed (PR #785 review-1).

        ``cancel_event`` enables cooperative cancellation by the pipeline's
        repair-phase ``asyncio.wait_for``. ``wait_for`` only releases the
        awaiting coroutine; it cannot interrupt a synchronous reviewer call
        running in the worker thread. If the event is set, this method
        raises :class:`RepairCancelled` at the next iteration boundary so no
        *further* ``reviewer.review`` calls run after the budget expires.
        The currently in-flight reviewer call still finishes naturally — that
        is a non-cancellable C/IO boundary in CPython — but the loop will not
        consume another review's worth of LLM time/cost (PR #785 review-3).
