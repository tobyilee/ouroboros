"""Aggressive LLM auto-fill substrate for non-converging interviews.

RFC #1256 §I3 (#1263 PR-1). When the interview cannot converge — max rounds
reached, ambiguity oscillating, phase deadline approaching — the engine must
aggressively fill the remaining open ledger slots through inference rather than
declaring non-convergence as a terminal cause. The user's absence of an answer
is never a sufficient reason to halt: every ``ooo auto`` session should be able
to reach a seed-ready ledger.

This module is the **pure substrate primitive only** and is intentionally NOT
wired into the interview driver loop yet (that is #1263 PR-2). It takes an
injected ``fill_slot`` callable (the LLM call) so it performs no IO itself and
is therefore safe to unit test and to run inside the bounded interview loop
without risking a hang.
