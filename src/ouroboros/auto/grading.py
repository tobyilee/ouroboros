        #1157 *Closure Policy*: when the interview closed on ledger
        evidence (``ledger_only`` / ``safe_default``), the LLM-derived
        ``ambiguity_score`` is acknowledged-stale by design — the
        ledger's structural completeness IS the ambiguity invariant
        and the standalone ``high_ambiguity_score`` blocker is
        suppressed. Other grading axes (coverage / testability /
        open_gap / blocker count / risk) remain unchanged. When
        ``closure_mode`` is None (legacy callers, tests, non-pipeline
        usage) the strict pre-#1157 behavior is retained.

        ``degraded`` carries #1257 PR-C's degraded-Seed signal. When
        ``True`` (or when ``seed.metadata.degraded`` itself is True and
        the caller leaves the parameter at ``None``), the deadline-
        recovery seeds produced by :func:`partial_seed_from_evidence`
        are treated as next-step surfaces instead of terminal blockers:

        * ``high_ambiguity_score`` is suppressed (the deliberately
          elevated ambiguity floor used to expose deadline-driven
          uncertainty to observers must not also re-block at the gate),
        * ``ledger_open_gap`` blockers are demoted to findings — the
          gaps are already mirrored on ``seed.metadata.unresolved_slots``
          and surfaced through ``constraints``, so the gate's job is to
          *report* them, not block on them.

        Other blockers — ``missing_goal``, ``seed_goal_mismatch``,
        ``high_risk_assumptions`` — remain hard blockers. The §I6
        contract requires that safety / destructive / goal-mismatch
        markers continue to terminate even when the degraded path is
        active.
