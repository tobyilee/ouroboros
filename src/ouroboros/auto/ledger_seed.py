    """Synthesize a degraded but executable Seed from an incomplete ledger.

    The primary use case is the interview-deadline closure ladder (#1257 PR-B):
    when ``ledger.is_seed_ready()`` is False but the deadline has fired, we
    still want to produce *some* product surface rather than terminating in
    ``interview_phase_deadline`` BLOCKED. The resulting Seed:

    * is a valid Pydantic :class:`~ouroboros.core.seed.Seed`,
    * preserves every active ledger entry (so partial work is not discarded),
    * records the unresolved sections in
      :attr:`~ouroboros.core.seed.SeedMetadata.unresolved_slots` for downstream
      gates to convert into next-step hints,
    * fills missing acceptance/verification slots with conservative smoke
      defaults, and
    * lists the unresolved slots in ``constraints`` so executors cannot
      silently overrun the deadline-driven recovery contract.

    ``goal`` remains a hard prerequisite: a *missing* goal (no active value at
    all) is a structural failure — no product can exist without one — and
    raises ``ValueError``. This is the only divergence from "fail-soft": if
    even the goal is unresolved, the deadline has nothing to recover into. A
    goal that is present but only WEAK / CONFLICTING / BLOCKED at the
    aggregate level (e.g. a confirmed goal followed by a later blocked or
    conflicting goal entry) is NOT a structural failure — the active value is
    used, but ``"goal"`` is surfaced in ``unresolved_slots`` and
    ``constraints`` so downstream gates see the contested provenance.

    The function performs no model or external IO; it is safe to call from
    deadline handlers without re-introducing latency that was the original
    timeout source.
