"""Read-only tail of the EventStore SQLite file (stdlib ``sqlite3``).

The EventStore is a plain SQLite DB (``~/.ouroboros/ouroboros.db`` by default); a
separate process can read it concurrently without touching the async writer. We
open it strictly read-only (``mode=ro``) so the dashboard can NEVER corrupt a
live run, and page by SQLite's implicit ``rowid`` — the same cursor dimension the
in-process ``EventStore.get_events_after`` uses.

We deliberately avoid SQLAlchemy/aiosqlite here: the dashboard must run as a tiny
dependency-free subprocess/thread, and reads are simple.
