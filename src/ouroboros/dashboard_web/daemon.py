"""Singleton dashboard daemon — one web server, reused by every run.

The dashboard must never spawn a server per MCP session/run (that compounds the
process sprawl the user is already fighting). Instead:

- The FIRST run that wants a dashboard elects and spawns ONE detached daemon
  process (survives the ephemeral MCP session that started it).
- Every later run discovers it via a state file and REUSES it — same port, same
  URL, just a different ``?run=<execution_id>``.
- The daemon self-selects a free port (port is auto), records it in the state
  file, and SELF-EXITS after an idle period so it never lingers as a zombie.

Election is race-safe: an ``O_EXCL`` lock file serializes spawns; losers wait for
the winner's state file. Stale lock/state (crashed daemon) is detected via a
``/healthz`` probe and a lock-age timeout, then taken over.
