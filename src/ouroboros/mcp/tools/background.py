"""Shared background-job pipeline for the ``Start*`` MCP tool handlers.

The fire-and-forget ``ouroboros_start_*`` tools all wrap their real work in
the same four-step pipeline:

1. ``allocate_job_id()`` — reserve a durable job id up front.
2. A ``should_cancel()`` pre-work guard so a job cancelled while still queued
   returns a terminal *cancelled* result instead of starting work.
3. ``run_with_agent_process(process_id="{scope}:{job_id}",
   cancel_key="mcp_job:{job_id}")`` — bind the runner to the AgentProcess
   acceptance boundary AND to the durable cancel marker
   :meth:`JobManager.cancel_job` writes under ``mcp_job:{job_id}``.
4. ``start_job(..., job_id=job_id)`` — enqueue and return the snapshot.

Extracting it here removes five copies and, more importantly, fixes a
divergence: ``StartEvaluateHandler`` and ``StartAutoHandler`` historically
wrapped their runner with ``lambda _handle: _runner()`` and passed **no**
``process_id`` / ``cancel_key``.  Because ``run_with_agent_process`` only
constructs a :class:`CheckpointStore` (the component that loads a persisted
cancel marker) when ``cancel_key or process_id`` is set, those two surfaces
wrote a durable ``mcp_job:{job_id}`` cancel marker that their agent process
could never observe — the restart-visible cancellation contract documented
on :meth:`JobManager._persist_durable_cancel` was silently broken for them.
Routing every ``Start*`` handler through this helper gives evaluate/auto the
same guard and cancel_key as evolve/execute/ralph, restoring that contract.

The helper deliberately does **not** build the receipt envelope: each
handler's receipt text/meta differs (lineage_id vs session_id vs auto's
dispatch_mode tuple), and some handlers compose work *around* enqueue
(auto's start-lease lifecycle, execute_seed's post-receipt idempotency
write).  The helper returns the :class:`JobSnapshot` so callers keep full
control of the receipt and of any compose-around bookkeeping.

        job_type: ``JobManager`` job_type tag (e.g. ``"evolve_step"``).
        intent: AgentProcess intent label (e.g. ``"evolve_step"``).
        process_scope: Prefix for the deterministic AgentProcess
            ``process_id`` (e.g. ``"evolve_step:{lineage_id}"``); the helper
            appends ``":{job_id}"``.
        initial_message: Human-readable queued message for the job snapshot.
        links: :class:`JobLinks` for the job (session/execution/lineage).
        work_fn: The inner work, invoked with the AgentProcess handle.  The
            helper wraps it with the standard ``should_cancel()`` pre-work
            guard so callers must not re-implement that check.
        cancelled_text: Text for the cancelled-before-work result.
        detached_tool_name: Public Start* tool to re-enter in the detached
            owner process when durable jobs are enabled.
        detached_arguments: JSON-safe arguments for ``detached_tool_name``.
        runtime_backend: Runtime override reproduced in the worker composition.
        llm_backend: LLM override reproduced in the worker composition.
        opencode_mode: OpenCode integration mode reproduced in the worker.
        on_detaching: Optional hook invoked only in the accepting process just
            before ownership is transferred. Auto uses it to release its
            parent-owned pending lease so the worker can reserve/claim one.
        on_started: Optional async hook invoked with the snapshot *after* a
            successful ``start_job`` and *before* this function returns — used
            by auto to update its start lease while still owning the snapshot.
        on_enqueue_failure: Optional async hook invoked if ``start_job``
            raises, *before* the exception is re-raised — used by auto to
            release its start lease.  The helper always closes the pending
            runner coroutine on failure regardless of this hook.

    Returns:
        The :class:`JobSnapshot` from a successful enqueue.

    Raises:
        Re-raises any exception from ``start_job`` after running
        ``on_enqueue_failure`` and closing the runner coroutine.
