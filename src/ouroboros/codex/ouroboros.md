# Ouroboros for Codex

Use Ouroboros commands when the user is asking to clarify requirements, generate a seed, run a seed, inspect workflow status, evaluate an execution, or manage Ouroboros setup.

## CRITICAL: MCP Tool Routing

When the user types `ooo <command>`, you MUST call the corresponding MCP tool.
Do NOT interpret `ooo` commands as natural language. ALWAYS route to the MCP tool.

| User Input | MCP Tool to Call |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `ooo interview "<topic>"` | `ouroboros_interview` with `initial_context` |
| `ooo interview "<answer>"` (follow-up) | `ouroboros_interview` with `answer` and `session_id` |
| `ooo seed [session_id]` | `ouroboros_generate_seed` |
| `ooo run <seed.yaml>` | `ouroboros_execute_seed` with `seed_path` |
| `ooo auto ...` | `ouroboros_auto` with the resolved `goal` / `resume` / option arguments |
| `ooo status [session_id]` | `ouroboros_session_status` |
| `ooo evaluate <session_id>` | `ouroboros_evaluate` |
| `ooo evolve ...` | `ouroboros_evolve_step` |
| `ooo cancel [execution_id]` | `ouroboros_cancel_execution` |
| `ooo unstuck` / `ooo lateral` | `ouroboros_lateral_think` |
| `ooo auto ...` | `ouroboros_auto` |

If `ouroboros_auto` is unavailable, stop and report that the MCP dispatch surface is broken. Do not manually emulate `ooo auto` with ordinary shell, GitHub, or coding work.

## Natural Language Mapping

For natural-language requests, map to the corresponding MCP tool:
- "clarify requirements", "interview me", "socratic interview" → call `ouroboros_interview`
- "generate a seed", "freeze requirements" → call `ouroboros_generate_seed`
- "run the seed", "execute the workflow" → call `ouroboros_execute_seed`
- "check status", "am I drifting?" → call `ouroboros_session_status`
- "evaluate", "verify the result" → call `ouroboros_evaluate`

## Auto Dispatch Safety

`ooo auto` has a strict product contract: bounded interview, Seed generation,
A-grade review/repair, and execution handoff. Do not emulate it with manual
shell, repository, or GitHub work.

If a user input starts with `ooo auto`, call `ouroboros_auto`. If that MCP tool
is unavailable, stop and report that `ouroboros_auto` is unavailable instead of
continuing as a normal Codex task.

## Setup & Update

- `ooo setup` → write Ouroboros config (`~/.ouroboros/config.yaml`) and register the MCP server
- `ooo update` → upgrade Ouroboros to the latest PyPI version

If the request is clearly unrelated to Ouroboros, handle it normally.
