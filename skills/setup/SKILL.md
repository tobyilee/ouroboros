# /ouroboros:setup

Guided onboarding wizard that converts users into power users.

> **Standalone users** (Codex, pip install): Use `ouroboros setup --runtime codex` in your terminal instead.
> This skill runs inside a Claude Code session. For other runtime backends, the CLI `ouroboros setup` command handles configuration.
> For full install and onboarding instructions, see [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md).

> **GitHub Copilot CLI users**: Run `ouroboros setup --runtime copilot` (after `pipx install 'ouroboros-ai[mcp]'` or `uv tool install 'ouroboros-ai[mcp]'`). Setup will:
>
> 1. Live-discover available models from the GitHub Copilot models API (uses `gh auth token`) and let you pick a default. A bundled fallback list is used when offline.
> 2. Write `orchestrator.runtime_backend = copilot` and `llm.backend = copilot` plus your chosen default into `~/.ouroboros/config.yaml`.
> 3. Register the MCP server in `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` so the next `copilot` session can call `ooo ...` skills.
>
> Hyphen Anthropic IDs that the Ouroboros defaults use (for example `claude-opus-4-6`) are auto-mapped at runtime to the dotted form Copilot CLI expects (`claude-opus-4.6`), so existing config files keep working when you switch backends.

## Usage

```
ooo setup
/ouroboros:setup
/ouroboros:setup --uninstall
```

> **Note**: Setup does two things:
> 1. **MCP server registration** (`~/.claude/mcp.json`) — one-time, global across all projects
> 2. **CLAUDE.md integration** (optional) — per-project, adds an Ouroboros command reference block
>
> After the first run, you only need to re-run setup in new projects if you want the CLAUDE.md integration.

## Setup Wizard Flow

When the user invokes this skill, guide them through an enhanced 6-step wizard with progressive disclosure and celebration checkpoints.

---

### Step 0: Welcome & Motivation (The Hook)

Start with energy and clear value:

```
Welcome to Ouroboros Setup!

Let's unlock your full AI development potential.

What you'll get:
- Visual TUI dashboard for real-time progress tracking
- 3-stage evaluation pipeline for quality assurance
- Drift detection to keep projects on track
- Cost optimization (85% savings on average)

Setup takes ~2 minutes. Let's go!
```

---

### Step 0.5: Community Support

Before we begin, check `~/.ouroboros/prefs.json` for `star_asked`. If not `true`, use **AskUserQuestion**:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Ouroboros is free and open-source. A GitHub star helps other developers discover it. Star the repo?",
    "header": "Community",
    "options": [
      {
        "label": "Star on GitHub",
        "description": "Takes 1 second — helps the project grow"
      },
      {
        "label": "Skip for now",
        "description": "Continue with setup"
      }
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

- **Star on GitHub**: Run `gh api -X PUT /user/starred/Q00/ouroboros`, save `{"star_asked": true}` to `~/.ouroboros/prefs.json`
- **Skip for now**: Save `{"star_asked": true}` to `~/.ouroboros/prefs.json`
- **Other**: Save `{"star_asked": true}`

Create `~/.ouroboros/` directory if it doesn't exist.

If `star_asked` is already `true`, skip this step silently.

---

### Step 1: Environment Detection

Check the user's environment with clear feedback:

```bash
python3 --version
which uvx 2>/dev/null && uvx --version 2>/dev/null
which claude 2>/dev/null
```

**IMPORTANT: If system Python is < 3.12 but uvx is available, also check uv-managed Python:**

```bash
uv python list 2>/dev/null | grep "cpython-3.1[2-9]"
```

If `uv python list` shows Python >= 3.12 available, this counts as **Full Mode** because `uvx ouroboros-ai mcp serve` automatically uses uv-managed Python >= 3.12 (not system Python).

**Report results with personality:**

```
Environment Detected:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

System Python 3.11         [!] Below 3.12
uv Python 3.12+            [✓] Available (uvx will use this)
uvx package runner         [✓] Available
Runtime backend            [✓] Detected

→ Full Mode Available (via uvx + uv-managed Python >= 3.12)
```

**Decision Matrix:**

| Environment | Mode | Action |
|:------------|:-----|:-------|
| uvx + Python >= 3.12 | **Ready** | Proceed to MCP registration (uvx mode — extras always included) |
| No uvx + `ouroboros` binary in PATH | **Check deps** | Verify `[claude]` extras, then proceed (binary mode) |
| No uvx + Python >= 3.12 + `python3 -m ouroboros` works | **Check deps** | Verify `[claude]` extras, then proceed (pip mode) |
| uvx + Python < 3.12 only | **Install needed** | Run `uv python install 3.12` then proceed |
| No uvx + no ouroboros binary + no pip package | **Install needed** | Install uv first, then proceed |

**For binary/pip modes — verify `[claude]` extras are installed:**

Check method depends on how ouroboros was installed:
```bash
# Detect install method
pipx list 2>/dev/null | grep -q ouroboros && echo "PIPX" || echo "NOT_PIPX"
```

- **pipx users** (binary mode, installed via pipx):
  ```bash
  pipx runpip ouroboros-ai show claude-agent-sdk 2>/dev/null && echo "DEPS_OK" || echo "DEPS_MISSING"
  ```
  If `DEPS_MISSING`: `pipx install --force ouroboros-ai[claude]`

- **pip users** (pip mode):
  ```bash
  python3 -c "import claude_agent_sdk" 2>/dev/null && echo "DEPS_OK" || echo "DEPS_MISSING"
  ```
  If `DEPS_MISSING`: `python3 -m pip install ouroboros-ai[claude]`

If deps are missing and the user doesn't want to fix manually, recommend uvx:
```
Or install uvx (recommended — handles deps automatically):
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
Then re-run: ooo setup
```

**IMPORTANT**: The MCP server requires one of: (1) uvx, (2) ouroboros binary in PATH, or (3) ouroboros pip-installed. For options 2 and 3, the `[claude]` extra must also be installed. If none are available, guide the user to install uv — do NOT write a non-working fallback to mcp.json.

**If prerequisites are missing, show:**
```
Ouroboros requires uvx (recommended) or the ouroboros package installed.

Quick install (< 1 minute):
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  uv python install 3.12

Then re-run: ooo setup
```

**Celebration Checkpoint 1:**
```
Great news! You're ready for the full Ouroboros experience.
```

---

### Step 2: MCP Server Registration

Check if `~/.claude/mcp.json` exists:

```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/mcp.json 2>/dev/null && echo "EXISTS" || echo "NOT_FOUND"
```

**Show progress:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Registering MCP Server...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Connecting Ouroboros Python core to your runtime backend.
This enables:

  Visual TUI Dashboard    [Watch execution in real-time]
  3-Stage Evaluation     [Mechanical → Semantic → Consensus]
  Drift Detection        [Alert when projects go off-track]
  Session Replay         [Debug any execution from events]
```

**Automatically create or update `~/.claude/mcp.json`** (user-level, works across all projects).

Choose the MCP command based on how ouroboros is installed (check in order):
1. If `which uvx` succeeds: `{"command": "uvx", "args": ["--from", "ouroboros-ai[claude]", "ouroboros", "mcp", "serve"]}`
2. If `which ouroboros` succeeds: `{"command": "ouroboros", "args": ["mcp", "serve"]}`
3. If `python3 -c "import ouroboros"` succeeds: `{"command": "python3", "args": ["-m", "ouroboros", "mcp", "serve"]}`
4. If none of the above → **do NOT write to mcp.json**. Instead show the prerequisites message from Step 1 and stop.

If `~/.claude/mcp.json` already exists, read it, **always overwrite the `ouroboros` key** with the entry above (to fix stale args from older versions), and preserve all other server entries.

**Celebration Checkpoint 2:**
```
MCP Server Registered! You can now:
- Run ooo run for visual TUI execution
- Run ooo evaluate for 3-stage verification
- Run ooo status for drift tracking
```

---

### Step 3: CLAUDE.md Integration (Optional)

Ask with clear value proposition:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  CLAUDE.md Integration
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Add Ouroboros quick-reference to your CLAUDE.md?

This gives you instant command reminders without leaving
your project context.

What gets added (~40 lines):
- Philosophy and pipeline overview
- Command routing table with lazy-loaded agents
- Agent catalog summary

A backup will be created: CLAUDE.md.bak

[Integrate / Skip / Preview first]

# Ouroboros — Specification-First AI Development

> Before telling AI what to build, define what should be built.
> As Socrates asked 2,500 years ago — "What do you truly know?"
> Ouroboros turns that question into an evolutionary AI workflow engine.

Most AI coding fails at the input, not the output. Ouroboros fixes this by
**exposing hidden assumptions before any code is written**.

1. **Socratic Clarity** — Question until ambiguity ≤ 0.2
2. **Ontological Precision** — Solve the root problem, not symptoms
3. **Evolutionary Loops** — Each evaluation cycle feeds back into better specs

```
Interview → Seed → Execute → Evaluate
    ↑                           ↓
    └─── Evolutionary Loop ─────┘
```

## ooo Commands

Each command loads its agent/MCP on-demand. Details in each skill file.

| Command | Loads |
|---------|-------|
| `ooo` | — |
| `ooo interview` | `ouroboros:socratic-interviewer` |
| `ooo seed` | `ouroboros:seed-architect` |
| `ooo run` | MCP required |
| `ooo evolve` | MCP: `evolve_step` |
| `ooo evaluate` | `ouroboros:evaluator` |
| `ooo unstuck` | `ouroboros:{persona}` |
| `ooo status` | MCP: `session_status` |
| `ooo setup` | — |
| `ooo help` | — |

## Agents

Loaded on-demand — not preloaded.

**Core**: socratic-interviewer, ontologist, seed-architect, evaluator,
wonder, reflect, advocate, contrarian, judge
**Support**: hacker, simplifier, researcher, architect
<!-- ooo:END -->
````

**If Integrate:**
1. Backup existing CLAUDE.md to CLAUDE.md.bak
2. Append the block above
3. Confirm successful integration

**Celebration Checkpoint 3:**
```
CLAUDE.md updated! You now have instant Ouroboros reference
available in every project.
```

### Step 4: Quick Verification

Run verification with visual feedback:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Verifying Setup...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Check skills are loadable:
```bash
ls skills/ | wc -l  # Should show 12+ skills
```

Check agents are available:
```bash
ls src/ouroboros/agents/*.md | wc -l  # Should show 20+ bundled agents
```

Check MCP registration (if enabled):
```bash
cat ~/.claude/mcp.json | grep -q ouroboros && echo "MCP: ✓" || echo "MCP: ✗"
```

### Step 5.5: Brownfield Repository Scan

Scan a root directory for existing git repositories and linked worktrees, then register them in the Ouroboros DB. This enables interviews to use brownfield context for existing projects.

**Show scanning indicator:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Scanning for Existing Projects...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Looking for git repositories and worktrees under the scan root directory.
Linked worktrees reported by discovered normal repo roots may also be registered, even outside the scan root directory.
Local repos and repos with any remote name are eligible.
This may take a moment...
```

**Implementation — use MCP tools only, do NOT use CLI or Python scripts:**

1. Load the brownfield MCP tool: `ToolSearch query: "+ouroboros brownfield"`
2. Call scan+register:
   ```
   Tool: ouroboros_brownfield
   Arguments: { "action": "scan" }
   ```
   This walks `scan_root` for valid seed repos/worktrees and registers them in DB. For each discovered normal repo root with a `.git` directory, Git-reported linked worktrees are also considered, even when they live outside `scan_root`. A linked worktree found under `scan_root` with a `.git` file is registered itself, but it is not used to register its main worktree or sibling worktrees outside `scan_root`. Existing defaults are preserved.

**Scan boundaries:**
- The filesystem walk starts at `scan_root`; when omitted, `scan_root` defaults to the current user's home directory.
- Repositories are only discovered directly by walking directories inside `scan_root`.
- Dot-prefixed directories and known noisy directories such as `node_modules` are not walked as seed locations.
- Git worktrees are different: once a normal repo root with a `.git` directory is discovered, Ouroboros runs `git worktree list --porcelain` and may register those linked worktrees even if their paths are outside `scan_root`.
- A linked worktree found inside `scan_root` with a `.git` file is registered itself, but it is not used to register its main worktree or sibling worktrees outside `scan_root`.
- Local repos, repos without remotes, and repos whose remotes are not named `origin` are all eligible.

The scan response `text` already contains a pre-formatted numbered list with `[default]` markers. **Do NOT make any additional MCP calls to list or query repos.**

**Display the repos in a plain-text 2-column grid** (NOT a markdown table). Use a code block so columns align. Example:

```
Scan complete. 8 repositories registered.

 1. repo-alpha                   5. repo-epsilon
 2. repo-bravo *                 6. repo-foxtrot
 3. repo-charlie                 7. repo-golf *
 4. repo-delta                   8. repo-hotel
```

Include `*` markers for defaults exactly as they appear in the scan response. Do not summarize or truncate the list. The user needs to see all repo numbers to pick defaults.

**If no repos found**, skip the default selection prompt and proceed to Step 6.

**Default repo selection — IMMEDIATELY after showing the list:**

Use `AskUserQuestion` with the current default numbers from the scan response.

**If defaults exist**, show them as the recommended option:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Which repos to set as default for interviews? Enter numbers like '6, 18, 19'.",
    "header": "Default Repos",
    "options": [
      {"label": "<current default numbers> (Recommended)", "description": "<current default names>"},
      {"label": "None", "description": "Clear all defaults — interviews will run in greenfield mode"},
      {"label": "Select repos", "description": "Type repo numbers to set as default"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

**If no defaults exist**, do NOT show a "(Recommended)" option — offer "None" and "Select repos" instead:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Which repos to set as default for interviews? Enter numbers like '6, 18, 19'.",
    "header": "Default Repos",
    "options": [
      {"label": "None", "description": "No default repos — interviews will run in greenfield mode"},
      {"label": "Select repos", "description": "Type repo numbers to set as default"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

The user can select the recommended defaults (if any), choose "None", or type custom numbers.

After the user responds, use ONE MCP call to update all defaults at once:

```
Tool: ouroboros_brownfield
Arguments: { "action": "set_defaults", "indices": "<comma-separated IDs>" }
```

Example: if the user picks IDs 6, 18, 19 → `{ "action": "set_defaults", "indices": "6,18,19" }`

This clears all existing defaults and sets the selected repos as default in one call.

If "none" → `{ "action": "set_defaults", "indices": "" }` to clear all defaults.

**Celebration Checkpoint 5.5:**
```
Brownfield defaults updated!
Defaults: podo-app, podo-backend, grape

These repos will be used as context in interviews.
```

Or if "none" selected:
```
No default repos set. interviews will run in greenfield mode.
You can set defaults anytime by running ooo setup again.
```

### Step 6: First Project Nudge

Encourage immediate action:

```

Your first Ouroboros project is waiting!

The best way to learn is by doing. Try:

  ooo interview "Build a CLI tool for [something you need]"

Or explore examples:
  ooo tutorial

You're going to love seeing vague ideas turn into
crystal-clear specifications. Let's build something amazing!
```

---

## Progressive Disclosure Schedule

Reveal features gradually to avoid overwhelm:

### Immediate (Plugin Mode)
- `ooo interview` - Socratic clarification
- `ooo seed` - Specification generation
- `ooo unstuck` - Lateral thinking

### After Setup (MCP Mode)
- `ooo run` - TUI execution
- `ooo evaluate` - 3-stage verification
- `ooo status` - Drift tracking

### Power User (Discover organically)
- Evolutionary loop and ralph persistence
- Cost prediction and optimization
- Session replay and debugging
- Custom agents and skills

---

## Uninstall

When invoked with `--uninstall`:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Ouroboros Uninstall
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This will remove:
- MCP server registration from ~/.claude/mcp.json
- Ouroboros block from CLAUDE.md

This will NOT remove:
- Plugin files in .claude-plugin/
- Any generated seeds or projects
- Your project data

Uninstall Ouroboros configuration? [Yes / No]
```

If Yes:
1. Remove `ouroboros` entry from `~/.claude/mcp.json` (if exists)
2. Remove `<!-- ooo:START -->` to `<!-- ooo:END -->` block from CLAUDE.md (if exists)
3. Confirm: "Ouroboros plugin configuration removed. To remove plugin files, run: claude plugin uninstall ouroboros"

---

## Setup Troubleshooting

### "python3: command not found"
```
Plugin mode still works! You can use:
- ooo interview
- ooo seed
- ooo unstuck

For Full Mode, install Python >= 3.12:
  macOS: brew install python@3.12
  Ubuntu: sudo apt install python3.12
  Windows: python.org/downloads
```

### "uvx: command not found"
```
uvx is recommended but not required. Alternative:

Install Ouroboros globally (see docs/getting-started.md for all options):
  pip install ouroboros-ai

Then update ~/.claude/mcp.json with:
  "command": "python"
  "args": ["-m", "ouroboros", "mcp", "serve"]
```

### "~/.claude/mcp.json conflicts"
```
Ouroboros will merge with existing MCP servers.
If you see issues, share your ~/.claude/mcp.json content and
we'll help you resolve conflicts.
```
