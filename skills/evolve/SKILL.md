# ooo evolve - Evolutionary Loop

## Description
Start, monitor, or rewind an evolutionary development loop. The loop iteratively
refines the ontology and acceptance criteria across generations until convergence.

## Flow
```
Gen 1: Interview → Seed(O₁) → Execute → Evaluate
Gen 2: Wonder → Reflect → Seed(O₂) → Execute → Evaluate
Gen 3: Wonder → Reflect → Seed(O₃) → Execute → Evaluate
...until ontology converges (similarity ≥ 0.95) or max 30 generations
```

## Usage

### Start a new evolutionary loop
```
ooo evolve "build a task management CLI"
```

### Fast mode (ontology-only, no execution)
```
ooo evolve "build a task management CLI" --no-execute
```

### Check lineage status
```
ooo evolve --status <lineage_id>
```

### Rewind to a previous generation
```
ooo evolve --rewind <lineage_id> <generation_number>
```

## Instructions

### Load MCP Tools (Required before Path A/B decision)

The Ouroboros MCP tools are often registered as **deferred tools** that must be explicitly loaded before use. **You MUST perform this step before deciding between Path A and Path B.**

1. Use the active runtime's tool-discovery capability to find and load the evolve MCP tools:
   ```
   tool discovery query: "+ouroboros evolve"
   ```
2. The tools will typically be named with prefix `mcp__plugin_ouroboros_ouroboros__` (e.g., `ouroboros_evolve_step`, `ouroboros_interview`, `ouroboros_generate_seed`). After runtime tool discovery returns, the tools become callable.
3. If the tools are callable — already exposed, or loaded by discovery — proceed to **Path A**. An empty discovery result for already-exposed tools is expected, not a failure. Proceed to **Path B** only if they are genuinely absent (no Ouroboros MCP server).

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT assume MCP tools are unavailable just because they don't appear in your immediate tool list. They are almost always available as deferred tools that need to be loaded first.

**CRITICAL — deferred-schema guard (prevents "Invalid tool parameters"):**
This skill makes `ouroboros_*` MCP calls across multiple turns, and each turn runs
in a fresh tool context. A deferred tool's schema loaded on one turn is NOT
guaranteed to still be loaded on the next. If you call any `ouroboros_*` MCP tool
while its schema is not loaded in the **current** turn, the runtime rejects the
call with **"Invalid tool parameters"** before it ever reaches the server.
Therefore: **immediately before EVERY `ouroboros_*` MCP call in this skill, re-run
the tool-discovery load query for the specific MCP tool or documented tool family
you are about to call**. Use `"+ouroboros evolve"` for `ouroboros_evolve_step`,
`ouroboros_lineage_status`, and the evolve flow's documented tool family;
use `"+ouroboros interview"` before `ouroboros_interview`, `"+ouroboros seed"`
before `ouroboros_generate_seed`, and `"+ouroboros lateral"` before
`ouroboros_lateral_think`. If a load returns no matching tool (and the tool is not already callable — an empty load for an already-exposed tool is an expected no-op, not absence), switch to the
documented fallback / Path B instead of retrying the failing call.

### Path A: MCP Available (loaded via runtime tool discovery above)

**Starting a new evolutionary loop:**
1. Parse the user's input as `initial_context`
2. Run the interview: call `ouroboros_interview` with `initial_context`
3. Complete the interview (3+ rounds until ambiguity ≤ 0.2)
4. Generate seed: call `ouroboros_generate_seed` with the `session_id`
5. Call `ouroboros_evolve_step` with:
   - `lineage_id`: new unique ID (e.g., `lin_<seed_id>`)
   - `seed_content`: the generated seed YAML
   - `execute`: `true` (default) for full Execute→Evaluate pipeline,
     `false` for fast ontology-only evolution (no seed execution)
6. Check the `action` in the response:
   - `continue` → Call `ouroboros_evolve_step` again with just `lineage_id`
   - `converged` → Evolution complete! Display final ontology
   - `stagnated` → Ontology unchanged for 3+ gens. Consider `ouroboros_lateral_think`
   - `exhausted` → Max 30 generations reached. Display best result
   - `failed` → Check error, possibly retry
7. **Repeat step 6** until action ≠ `continue`
8. When the loop terminates, display a result summary with next step:
   - `converged`: `◆ Current state → next: Ontology converged! Run ooo evaluate for formal verification`
   - `stagnated`: `◆ Current state → next: ooo unstuck to break through, then ooo evolve --status <lineage_id> to resume`
   - `exhausted`: `◆ Current state → next: ooo evaluate to check best result — or ooo unstuck to try a new approach`
   - `failed`: `◆ Current state → next: Check the error above. ooo status to inspect session, or ooo unstuck if blocked`

**Checking status:**
1. Call `ouroboros_lineage_status` with the `lineage_id`
2. Display: generation count, ontology evolution, convergence progress

**Rewinding:**
1. Call `ouroboros_evolve_step` with:
   - `lineage_id`: the lineage to continue from a rewind point
   - `seed_content`: the seed YAML from the target generation
   (Future: dedicated `ouroboros_evolve_rewind` tool)

### Path B: Plugin-only (no MCP tools available)

If MCP tools are not available, explain the evolutionary loop concept and
suggest installing the Ouroboros MCP server. See [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for install options, then run:

```
ouroboros mcp serve
```

Then add to your runtime's MCP configuration (e.g., `~/.claude/mcp.json` for Claude Code).

## Key Concepts

- **Wonder**: "What do we still not know?" - examines evaluation results
  to identify ontological gaps and hidden assumptions
- **Reflect**: "How should the ontology evolve?" - proposes specific
  mutations to fields, acceptance criteria, and constraints
- **Convergence**: Loop stops when ontology similarity ≥ 0.95 between
  consecutive generations, or after 30 generations max
- **Rewind**: Each generation is a snapshot. You can rewind to any
  generation and branch evolution from there
- **evolve_step**: Runs exactly ONE generation per call. Designed for
  Ralph integration — state is fully reconstructed from events between calls
- **execute flag**: `true` (default) runs full Execute→Evaluate each generation.
  `false` skips execution for fast ontology exploration. Previous generation's
  execution output is fed into Wonder/Reflect for informed evolution
- **QA verdict**: Each generation's response includes a QA Verdict section
  (when `execute=true` and `skip_qa` is not set). Use the QA score to track
  quality progression across generations. Pass `skip_qa: true` to disable

## RFC #1392 State Breadcrumb Footer

Your final response MUST end with exactly one breadcrumb footer line:

```
◆ <current state> → next: <recommended action>
```

Derive `<current state>` from live session state via `ouroboros_session_status` when that MCP projection is available; otherwise derive it from this skill's actual outcome. Never use a linear `Step N of M` footer because Ouroboros is an evolutionary loop. When the next action is genuinely a choice, list 2-3 honest options in the `next:` clause. The breadcrumb line must be the last line of the response.
