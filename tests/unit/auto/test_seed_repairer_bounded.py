"""Bounded-iteration regression tests for SeedRepairer.converge.

Issue #775 introduces an explicit ``max_iterations`` cap on the convergence
loop and an outer ``asyncio.wait_for`` budget around the synchronous
``repairer.converge`` call inside ``AutoPipeline.run``. These tests pin both
guarantees so a future regression cannot reintroduce an unbounded LLM-spend
hang.

# AC: ``converge`` honors a cancel signal at iteration boundaries.
# Regression for PR #785 review-3: the repair-phase ``asyncio.wait_for`` only
# releases the awaiter; without a cooperative signal, the loop kept calling
# ``reviewer.review`` after the timeout, burning more LLM cost than the
# advertised budget. ``cancel_event`` makes the loop exit at the next
# checkpoint instead of starting another review/repair iteration.
