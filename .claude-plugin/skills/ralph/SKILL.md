# /ouroboros:ralph

MCP-owned Ralph loop around background `evolve_step` jobs. "The boulder never stops."

## Usage

```
ooo ralph --lineage-id <lineage_id>
/ouroboros:ralph --lineage-id <lineage_id>

# For a plain natural-language request, run `ooo interview` + `ooo seed` first,
# then call the MCP tool with a fresh lineage_id and the validated Seed YAML.
```

**Trigger keywords:** "ralph", "don't stop", "must complete", "until it works", "keep going"

## How It Works

Ralph is owned by the `ouroboros_ralph` MCP tool. In non-plugin runtimes, the
tool starts one background Ralph job, runs repeated `evolve_step` generations
inside that job, and stops only when QA passes, convergence is reached, a
terminal evolution action occurs, cancellation is requested, or
`max_generations` is reached. In OpenCode plugin mode, the MCP tool returns a
`delegated_to_plugin` envelope with `job_id=None`; the bridge plugin dispatches
a child Task session that owns the loop instead of creating a local JobManager
job.

The client skill should not reimplement the loop. Deterministic frontmatter
dispatch is limited to the router's named `--lineage-id` option so raw trailing
text is never treated as lineage identity. Raw natural-language
`ooo ralph "<request>"` input must flow through the validated Seed path before
any mutating Ralph loop starts. Until a lineage id and optional Seed YAML are
prepared, `ouroboros_ralph` returns structured input guidance instead of
starting a job. Once the inputs are prepared, start the MCP-owned Ralph surface
once, then follow either the returned job tools path or the OpenCode Task widget
path.

## Instructions

When the user invokes this skill:

### Load MCP Tools (Required first)

The Ouroboros MCP tools are often registered as deferred tools that must be
explicitly loaded before use. Do this before preparing input or calling Ralph:

1. Use the active runtime's tool-discovery capability to find and load the Ralph/job MCP tools:
   ```
   tool discovery query: "+ouroboros ralph job"
   ```
2. The loaded tools may be exposed under plugin-prefixed names such as
   `mcp__plugin_ouroboros_ouroboros__ouroboros_ralph`. Use the actual tool
   names returned by runtime tool discovery; the bare names below are the canonical MCP
   tool names for documentation.
3. Confirm that `ouroboros_ralph` and the job tools (`ouroboros_job_wait`,
   `ouroboros_job_status`, `ouroboros_job_result`, and
   `ouroboros_cancel_job`) are callable. If the tools are unavailable, stop and
   tell the user that Ralph requires the Ouroboros MCP runtime.

### Ralph Flow

1. **Prepare lineage input**:
   - If the user provides an existing `lineage_id` and explicitly wants to
     continue it, reuse that `lineage_id` and omit `seed_content` unless they
     explicitly provide an updated Seed.
   - If the user provides Seed YAML for a new Ralph run, use it as
     `seed_content` and generate a fresh `lineage_id` for this run. Keep
     `lineage_id` separate from Seed, interview, and session IDs so separate
     Ralph runs over the same Seed do not collide.
   - If the user provides only a plain natural-language request, do not treat
     it as a direct `ooo ralph "<request>"` command, do not freehand Seed YAML,
     and do not pass raw text as `seed_content`. Route through the authoritative
     Seed path first: `ooo interview` to capture requirements, then `ooo seed` /
     `ouroboros_generate_seed` to produce validated Seed YAML with the normal
     ambiguity gate. After Seed generation, call the MCP tool with a fresh
     `lineage_id` and that validated Seed YAML as `seed_content`; do not use the
     raw request text. If an interview/seed session already exists in context,
     reuse that validated Seed output instead of regenerating it.

2. **Start Ralph** by calling `ouroboros_ralph` with:
   - `lineage_id`: existing lineage id for an explicit continuation, otherwise a
     freshly generated stable id for this Ralph run, such as
     `ralph-<short-slug>-<uuid>`; do not use a Seed/interview id by itself
   - `seed_content`: valid Seed YAML for generation 1 when starting a new lineage
   - `execute`: default `true`
   - `parallel`: default `true`
   - `skip_qa`: default `false`
   - `project_dir`: explicit target project directory when known
   - `max_generations`: default `10` unless the user requests a tighter bound

3. **Handle the start response**:
   - If `response.meta.job_id` is present, report it concisely and retain the
     job cursor from `response.meta.cursor`:

     ```
     [Ralph] Started background loop: <job_id>
     Lineage: <lineage_id>
     Live view: <response.meta.dashboard_url, or `ouroboros tui open`>

     A read-only observer will report meaningful progress, attention, and terminal
     events here. This conversation remains available for other safe work.
     ```

   - If `response.meta.job_observer` is present and the host supports an
     independent Task/Agent child, spawn exactly one read-only observer and pass
     the contract unchanged. It owns wait/result and the cursor exclusively. The
     main session must not poll the same job. Keep the conversation available for
     read-only review, explicit control, or unrelated work in an isolated
     worktree; check active-worker overlap before writing to Ralph's workspace.
     Do not claim an observer until Task/Agent returns a live child handle. If
     child creation fails, do not promise live proactive relays. The detached
     worker survives the stdio turn; catch up from durable events on the next
     parent turn or explicit status request. Keep the turn open only for
     explicit live watching.

   - If `response.meta.status == "delegated_to_plugin"` and
     `response.meta.job_id is None`, report that OpenCode plugin mode delegated
     the loop to a child Task session. Do not call `ouroboros_job_wait`,
     `ouroboros_job_result`, or `ouroboros_cancel_job` without a job id; follow
     the host Task widget/session lifecycle instead.

4. **Monitor non-plugin progress in the polling owner** when a `job_id` exists.

   The delegated observer is the default owner. Use the main-session loop only
   when no independent child exists and the user asked for live watching;
   otherwise catch up on the next parent turn. Never run both:
   - `ouroboros_job_wait(job_id, cursor, timeout_seconds=120, stream="linked", wait_for="attention_or_ac_change")` for long polling;
     after every wait/status response, update `cursor = response.meta.cursor`
   - `ouroboros_job_status(job_id)` for a quick status check
   - `ouroboros_job_result(job_id)` when the job is terminal
   - `ouroboros_cancel_job(job_id)` if the user says stop/cancel

   Relay Synapse `queued`, `applied`, `completed`, `rejected`, and
   `delivery_uncertain` states in the user's current conversation language.
   Never describe `queued` as applied, and surface rejected or uncertain
   delivery immediately.
   Also relay run configuration, total ACs and dependency/parallel levels, first
   scheduled ACs, bounded Discover targets, material model/harness changes,
   level transitions, and verified AC completion. Never expose raw commands or
   model reasoning.

   For a live AC question or additive refinement, reload
   `+ouroboros session signal`, call `ouroboros_session_signal_targets`, and
   semantically select the relevant AC without asking for internal IDs. Use
   `mode="inform"` for read-only assurance and omit `fallback_mode` in that
   mode. Use exact guards with
   `contract_effect="additive"`, `source="user"`, `mode="redirect"`, and explicit
   `fallback_mode="after_turn"` for implementation refinement. Shared contract
   changes require an approved successor.

5. **On non-plugin job termination**, fetch `ouroboros_job_result(job_id)` and
   summarize the final job result and next step:
   - Success / convergence: summarize the final generation output, QA verdict,
     and any `worktree_path` / `worktree_branch` returned in job metadata. Do not
     present `ooo evaluate` as an automatic next step for Ralph results: the
     Ralph job contract preserves the evolution `lineage_id`, but it does not
     reliably preserve a separate execution `session_id` for the evaluate
     workflow. If a valid execution `session_id` is explicitly available from a
     separate run result, keep it distinct from the Ralph `lineage_id` and follow
     the `ooo evaluate <session_id>` contract; otherwise state that formal
     evaluation needs a real execution session and should not be invoked from the
     Ralph lineage id alone.
   - Max generations / failure: summarize the stop reason and suggest
     `ooo unstuck`, `ooo interview`, or a narrower Ralph retry
   - Cancelled: confirm cancellation and preserve the job id for later inspection

6. **On OpenCode plugin delegation**, rely on the child Task result as the
   terminal surface. Summarize the Task completion/error state and lineage id; do
   not claim a local Ralph job can be polled or cancelled.

### Active Conductor decision policy

For `attention_required`, use at most one short-lived read-only verifier. Without
that primitive, surface the evidence and do not ACT. Otherwise VERIFY → DECIDE
from `recommended_host_actions` → LOG `selected` with
`ouroboros_record_conductor_decision` → ACT only a menu-listed registered tool →
LOG one `completed`, `failed`, or `declined` outcome. Ralph may use a directive
only for the first and sole bounded successor generation (`max_generations=1`),
and only when deterministic and non-relaxing.

These are English canonical instructions. Render them naturally in the user's
conversation language.

## Tool Mapping

| Skill action | MCP tool |
| --- | --- |
| Start Ralph loop | `ouroboros_ralph` |
| Wait for progress | `ouroboros_job_wait` |
| Fetch final result | `ouroboros_job_result` |
| Cancel loop | `ouroboros_cancel_job` |
| Inspect current status | `ouroboros_job_status` |

## The Boulder Never Stops

This is the key phrase. Ralph does not give up:

- Each failure is data for the next attempt.
- Verification drives the loop.
- Only success, convergence, terminal failure, cancellation, or max-generation
  limits stop it.
