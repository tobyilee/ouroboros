# /ouroboros:auto

Run the full-quality auto pipeline from a single task description.

## Dispatch requirement

This skill must be executed by invoking MCP tool `ouroboros_auto`. Do not
manually inspect repositories, run shell commands, query GitHub, edit files, or
otherwise emulate the auto pipeline as a substitute.

If `ouroboros_auto` is unavailable, stop and report that the required MCP tool
is unavailable. A manual fallback is not an `ooo auto` run.

If `ouroboros_auto` is invoked successfully but returns `blocked`, `failed`, or
another terminal auto-session status, report that auto-session status and the
tool's blocker. Do not label that outcome as MCP dispatch failure; dispatch
failure means the MCP tool could not be invoked.

## Usage

```text
ooo auto "Build a local-first habit tracker CLI"
ooo auto --resume auto_abc123
ooo auto "Build a local-first habit tracker CLI" --skip-run
ooo auto "Build a local-first habit tracker CLI" --complete-product
/ouroboros:auto "Build a local-first habit tracker CLI"
```

## CLI flag → MCP arg translation

When the user types `ooo auto` with CLI-style flags inside chat, translate to MCP arguments before invoking `ouroboros_auto`:

| CLI flag | MCP arg | Type |
|----------|---------|------|
| `--complete-product` | `complete_product=true` | boolean |
| `--skip-run` | `skip_run=true` | boolean |
| `--max-interview-rounds N` | `max_interview_rounds=N` | integer |
| `--max-repair-rounds N` | `max_repair_rounds=N` | integer |
| `--pipeline-timeout-seconds X` | `pipeline_timeout_seconds=X` | number |
| `--resume <id>` | `resume=<id>` | string |

`--max-generations` is **not** a flag for `ooo auto`; it belongs to `ooo ralph`. When `complete_product=true`, the chained Ralph uses its built-in default (10 generations) bounded by `pipeline_timeout_seconds` or Ralph's own per-iteration / wall-clock budgets.

`--pipeline-timeout-seconds` is accepted only when starting a session. Passing it with `--resume` is rejected because the original deadline is preserved across process restarts.

## Behavior

1. Starts an auto session.
2. Runs bounded Socratic interview rounds with source-tagged auto answers.
3. Generates a Seed.
4. Reviews and repairs until A-grade or blocked.
5. Starts execution only after A-grade.
6. When `complete_product=true`, chains RUN → RALPH_HANDOFF after a successful run handoff and waits for a terminal Ralph status so a single invocation iterates Ralph until QA passes, convergence, or a budget bound trips. A QA-pass on the executed product completes the auto session; recognized failure modes (`iteration_timeout`, `wall_clock_exhausted`, `oscillation_detected`, `grade_regressing`, `max_generations reached`) block the auto session with the matching `stop_reason` in `last_error` so operators can resume after the cause is addressed.

### Canonical stop_reason_code taxonomy

| Layer | Code | Surface | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Interview | `interview_max_rounds_exhausted` | `last_error_code`, `result.stop_reason_code` | Auto interview ran `max_interview_rounds` without ledger+backend mutual closure, no section was safely defaultable, and no partial defaults applied — i.e. genuine deadlock with nothing the policy could close. |
| Interview | `interview_unsafe_gaps_remain` | `last_error_code`, `result.stop_reason_code` | Auto interview ran `max_interview_rounds` with at least one section safely defaultable and at least one section remaining unsafe (e.g. CONFLICTING ledger entry, production/credential context). Partial defaults are rolled back so the persisted transcript and ledger stay aligned; resume can address the unsafe gap and re-run. |
| Interview | `interview_phase_deadline` | `last_error_code`, `result.stop_reason_code` | Interview phase exceeded its per-phase timeout. |
| Ralph | `iteration_timeout` | blocker text + (future) `result.stop_reason_code` | A single Ralph iteration exceeded its per-iteration timeout. |
| Ralph | `wall_clock_exhausted` | blocker text + (future) `result.stop_reason_code` | The Ralph wall-clock budget was exhausted before convergence. |
| Ralph | `oscillation_detected` | blocker text + (future) `result.stop_reason_code` | Ralph oscillated between two grade states without making progress. |
| Ralph | `grade_regressing` | blocker text + (future) `result.stop_reason_code` | A subsequent Ralph generation produced a strictly worse grade than its predecessor. |
| Ralph | `max_generations reached` | blocker text + (future) `result.stop_reason_code` | Ralph hit its configured generation cap before reaching A grade. |

Blockers without a canonical code keep using the free-form ``last_error`` text. Ralph-layer codes are surfaced via blocker text today; their result-envelope promotion is tracked as a follow-up.

### Interview closure mode taxonomy

When `result.status == "seed_ready"`, `result.interview_closure_mode` distinguishes how the interview was closed:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `None` | Mutual agreement — both the backend and the ledger declared the seed ready in the same round. The default healthy path. |
| `"ledger_only"` | PR-B1 / #1148: `max_rounds` hit; the ledger was structurally complete but the backend refused to declare closure. The interview closes on ledger-only consensus. Defaulted sections (if any) are tagged in `result.defaulted_sections`. |
| `"safe_default"` | PR-B2: `max_rounds` hit; the safe-default policy successfully filled every remaining required gap with auditable assumptions. Synthesis was pushed back into the persisted transcript so the seed generator sees the same assumptions the ledger records. Defaulted sections are tagged in `result.defaulted_sections`. |

Genuine-deadlock and partial-unsafe outcomes do **not** set `interview_closure_mode`; they reach a `blocked` terminal with the matching `stop_reason_code` above instead.

### Assumption-source provenance (PR-C2 / #1157)

`result.assumptions: tuple[str, ...]` (the existing list of assumption texts) is now accompanied by `result.assumption_sources: tuple[AssumptionRecord, ...]`, where each `AssumptionRecord` is a frozen dataclass with:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | `str` | The assumption text (same surface as the corresponding `assumptions` entry where present). |
| `source` | `str` | One of `"assumption"` (auto-answerer fallback), `"inference"` (model reasoning), `"conservative_default"` (safe-default policy). These are the three assumption-class `LedgerSource` values that produce `assumption_only_sections`. |
| `confidence` | `float` | Per-entry confidence as recorded by the ledger. |

`assumption_sources` is a *broader* surface than `assumptions` — it includes inference- and conservative-default-class entries that `assumptions` (filtered to `LedgerSource.ASSUMPTION` only) does not surface. Callers wanting to know *which assumptions the system made on the user's behalf* should read `assumption_sources`; callers preserving the older string-only contract continue to read `assumptions`.

The pipeline must not hang indefinitely: all loops are bounded and timeout failures return a resumable `auto_session_id`. Resume with `ooo auto --resume <auto_session_id>`. Use `--skip-run` to stop after the A-grade Seed. Use `--complete-product` to drive the full Interview → Seed → Run → Ralph → Product chain on a single `ooo auto` invocation; the chained Ralph loop honors the same wall-clock deadline as the parent auto session (`--timeout`). The CLI-only `--show-ledger` flag prints assumptions/non-goals; MCP skill responses already include the same ledger summary when available.
